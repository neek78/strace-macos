"""
Test advanced process syscalls.

Tests coverage for:
- getpriority, setpriority (scheduling priority with PRIO_* constant decoding)
- getrlimit, setrlimit (resource limits with RLIMIT_* constants and struct rlimit decoding)
- getrusage (resource usage with RUSAGE_* constants and struct rusage decoding)

Note: The following syscalls have no public prototypes and are not included:
- proc_info, proc_info_extended_id, proc_trace_log, proc_uuid_policy, process_policy, proc_rlimit_control
- pid_suspend, pid_resume, pid_hibernate, pid_shutdown_sockets
- thread_selfid, thread_selfusage, gettid, settid, settid_with_pid
